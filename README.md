# Angular Custom Grid & Chart Application

This project demonstrates a responsive Angular application with a **custom-built grid** and **charts**, incorporating best practices for scalable enterprise development â€” without relying on third-party UI libraries like Bootstrap, Material, or Tailwind.

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Grid Functionality
- Fully custom-built HTML/CSS/SCSS Grid (no external libraries)
- Dynamic grid column rendering based on API structure
- Local-only `Add`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations

- Responsive layout using **SCSS + Flexbox**
- No data persistence (data resets on refresh)

### âœ… API Integration
- API: `https://01.fy25ey01.64mb.io/`
- API fetches grid metadata (column headers, properties like alignment and colors)
- Open endpoint, but integration is structured as if for production
- Built using Angular's **HttpClient** with:
  - Centralized API service
  - Error handling and loading state management
  - Reusable data interfaces

### âœ… UI/UX
- Custom styling using **pure SCSS** (no inline styles, no design frameworks)
- SCSS inheritance and reusable mixins
- Mobile-friendly layout using Flexbox
- Chart support using `Highcharts`
- Detailed attention to:
  - Font sizing and spacing
  - Border-radius, hover effects
  - Color palette and gradient application

### âœ… Navigation

- Separate bottom section for profile/settings icons

### âœ… Loading State
- Custom loading spinner shown while data is being fetched
